# 2020 NASA Space Apps Challenge
## Team: The Red Planet
* Stephen Scott (McMaster University)
* Evan Bernard (University of Waterloo)
* Andrew Cramp (Queen's University)
* Daniel Wise (McMaster University)
## Challenge: Can You Hear Me Now?
* Explore the challenges in communicating with astronauts on Mars from Earth
## Solution: Red Rover
* Interactive 3D application developed in Unity (C#)
* Modelled partial solar system based on Newtonian physics
* Allows user's to program commands for the Perseverance rover on the surface of Mars
* Commands are sent flying through space, and are only executed after being received at Mars
* Demonstrates the challenge of dealing with communication latency over vast distances in space
## How To Play
* Hit `spacebar` to enable command log
* Use `arrow keys` (i.e. `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`) to program robot maneuvers
* Hit `spacebar` again to confirm the command packet
* `Left-click` Earth to send the command packet to Mars
* The Perseverance rover should move according to the programmed commands once the packet arrives at Mars
